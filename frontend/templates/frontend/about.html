<div class="about">
  <p>
    SAGE (Software for Agricultural Ecosystems) is a collection of software applications that supports the public pursuit of 
    sustainable agriculture, in cooperation with the Southern California sustainable agriculture community. This project was completed in 2019 and has not been developed since, though code base has been updated to modern package standards as of 2022.

  <p>
    The SAGE Plant Database is a database of plants used for grassroots or amateur agroecology design, including ethnobotanical, 
    cultivation, morphological, and phenological data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The SAGE Composer is be a design tool for creating sustainable polycultures (i.e., assemblages of complementary and mutually 
    beneficial plant species, typically composed primarily of perennials) for personal use.
